# Learning-C
Showcases my progress while I learn C Programming
- Day 1: Just did a small "hello world" program to get started
- Day 2: Did an identical hello program to the previous one mainly to demonstrate the use of \n (newline character) + wrote a program with variations to specify use of variables and format specifier for the int datatype (%d)
